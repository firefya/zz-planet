üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up for Local Development
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (latest LTS version recommended) ‚Üí Download Here
npm (comes with Node.js) ‚Üí Check if installed:
bash
Copy
Edit
node -v   # Check Node.js version  
npm -v    # Check npm version  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Cloning the Repo & Installing Dependencies
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install project dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Development Server
To start the local development server, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will spin up the application for local development. Changes will reflect automatically if hot-reloading is enabled.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Running Tests Locally
Before committing code, run tests to ensure everything works:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm test
or, for watching test files while coding:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test:watch
5Ô∏è‚É£ Running Linting & Formatting Checks
To maintain code consistency, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run lint    # Check for linting issues  
npm run format  # Auto-format code  
üîç Debugging Common Development Issues
1Ô∏è‚É£ npm install Fails / Dependency Issues
If you see errors during npm install, try clearing npm cache:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm cache clean --force
npm install
If issues persist, delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall:
bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
2Ô∏è‚É£ "Port Already in Use" When Running npm run dev
Sometimes the development server fails to start because another process is using the default port. To fix this:
bash
Copy
Edit
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)  # Replace 3000 with your app‚Äôs port
npm run dev
Alternatively, change the port manually in .env or package.json scripts.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Tests Failing Locally but Passing in CI/CD
Make sure dependencies are correctly installed:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run tests in watch mode to debug issues:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test:watch
If using Jest, try running with logging enabled:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm test -- --verbose

üìñ Best Practices for Collaboration
‚úÖ Branching Strategy
main branch ‚Üí Always stable, production-ready code.
Feature branches (feature-xyz) ‚Üí Work on separate features or fixes.
Always pull latest changes before working on a new branch:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
‚úÖ Creating a Pull Request (PR)
Push your feature branch to GitHub:
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin my-feature-branch
Open a PR in GitHub from your branch ‚Üí main.
Assign reviewers & wait for approval before merging.
Ensure CI/CD checks pass before merging.
Delete your branch after merging:
bash
Copy
Edit
git branch -d my-feature-branch
git push origin --delete my-feature-branch
